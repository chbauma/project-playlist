#Playlist generator#


Our idea is, to cerate playlists for the student Radio “Radio Radius”.
Several presenters created a music-library on the server of the radio
station. We now want to write a program, that allows the presenters to
create new playlists out of this music-library. We want to do this with
key words that are part of the song titles in this library.
To do this, we need a Loop, that searches the library for these key
words and that copies matching titles into a new folder.
The other task will be to create a list with all these key words.

So far we are in the early stages of this process:
